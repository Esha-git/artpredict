            Our classification model aids clinicians in making informed decisions regarding antiretroviral treatment responses. 
            By leveraging patient data such as viral load, CD4 count, and adherence, the model helps identify the best treatment options. 
            The public also benefits from more effective health care services, leading to improved patient outcomes and personalized care.
